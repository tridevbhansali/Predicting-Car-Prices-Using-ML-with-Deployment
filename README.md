# Predicting Car Prices Using Machine Learning with Deployment
This project utilizes machine learning to predict car prices based on various features such as make, model, year, and kilometer. It involves data collection, data cleaning, feature selection, model selection, and evaluation to create an accurate prediction model. The final model will be deployed in AWS server

## Project Overview 
* Created an accurate model that can predict the prices of used car
* Enter your car details like brand name, model name, km ,etc in the web app and find out
* Predicts correctly with an 83% accuracy
* Collected the data, Cleaned the data and prepared the data for model training
* Optimized Naive bayes, Logistic regression, decision tree, random forest using ensembling methods to reach the best model.
* Finally a soft voting ramdom forest regressor achieved the best accuracy.
